            <p class="question">Why do we need these practices?</p>

                <p class="answer">We rely on CSS best practices to create websites that are clean,
                    adaptable, and easy to maintain — 
                    especially as layouts evolve and collaborative development becomes more essential.
                    They serve as a foundation for consistency and efficiency,
                    helping your designs stay functional across devices and team workflows.</p>

            <p class="question">What are the consequences of skipping these practices?</p>

                <p class="answer">Ignoring CSS best practices might seem trivial at first,
                    but it can quickly unravel into a chaotic mess—slowing development,
                    creating confusion for your team, and leading to broken designs on different devices</p>

            <p class="question">What is the best way to remember these rules?</p> 

            <!--longer sentences cut to display on multiple lines for better readability of code-->
                <p class="answer">Best ways to remember these practices: Use checklists while coding,
                    practice with purpose, use Mnemonics or Acronyms: C.R.O.W.N.F.L.U.V.V.</p>
